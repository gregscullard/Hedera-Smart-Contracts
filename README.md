# Hedera Smart Contracts

This is a collection of sample projects, tests and trials. Some are just experiments of my own, others are there to help community members solve particular challenges.

Note: These repositories are not necessarily maintained regularly and may not be fully up to date.

## Project list

### child-contract

Shows a contract `MomContract` creating another contract `DaughterContract` when `MomContract` is constructed.

The example also queries `MomContract` and `DaughterContract` to show the construction was successful
